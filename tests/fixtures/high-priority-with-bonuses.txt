Jane Smith

### What's the toil?

I manually copy deploy logs from our CI system into a shared spreadsheet after every release. Takes ~45 minutes per release and I have to verify links manually.

### How often does it happen?

🟠 Daily

### How long does it take each time?

30–60 minutes

### Who is affected?

Entire team

### Bonus factors (optional)

- [x] ❌ Error-prone — this toil frequently causes mistakes or data errors
- [ ] 😤 Morale killer — this toil is particularly frustrating or demoralizing
- [x] 🔗 Blocking — this toil blocks other people or downstream processes

### Automation idea (if any)

A GitHub Action triggered on release events could auto-format and post deploy logs.
