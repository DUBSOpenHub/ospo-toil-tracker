### What's the toil?

Every morning I manually review and approve Dependabot PRs across our org's repos. 95% are safe patch bumps that could be auto-merged.

### How often does it happen?

🔴 Multiple times per day

### How long does it take each time?

> 1 hour

### Who is affected?

Multiple teams / org-wide

### Bonus factors (optional)

- [x] ❌ Error-prone — this toil frequently causes mistakes or data errors
- [x] 😤 Morale killer — this toil is particularly frustrating or demoralizing
- [x] 🔗 Blocking — this toil blocks other people or downstream processes

### Automation idea (if any)

Auto-merge Dependabot PRs that only bump patch versions and pass all CI checks.
