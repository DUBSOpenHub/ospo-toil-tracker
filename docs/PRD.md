# Product Requirements Document — AI Toil Tracker

## Problem

Every team has repetitive, manual work — toil — that drains time, morale, and focus. Most of it goes untracked because there's no easy way to surface it, score it, or decide what to automate first. Teams end up guessing instead of prioritizing.

## Solution

A zero-dependency, GitHub-native system that lets any team member log toil in under two minutes, have AI automatically score and triage it, and see the full picture on a live dashboard — all without leaving GitHub.

## Target Users

| Persona | Needs |
|---------|-------|
| **Individual Contributor** | Quick way to log repetitive work; see that it's being tracked and prioritized |
| **Team Lead / Manager** | Visibility into toil load across the team; data for automation investment decisions |
| **Org Leadership** | Monthly ROI summaries; automation rate trends; time-savings metrics |

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Capture — Issue Forms

- **Toil Idea** form (`toil-idea.yml`): name, team, description, frequency, time, people affected, category, automation idea
- **Log Win** form (`log-win.yml`): what was automated, related toil issue, time saved, effort to build, people who benefit
- **Automation Proposal** template: free-form Markdown for detailed solution designs
- Security reminder on every form — no secrets, no customer data

### 2. Score & Triage — AI Workflow

- Triggers automatically on every new toil issue (`ai-triage.yml`)
- **Scoring formula**: `frequency × time × people = toil score`
- Score-to-priority mapping:
  - 🔴 Critical ≥ 40
  - 🟡 High ≥ 20
  - 🟢 Medium ≥ 10
  - ⚪ Low < 10
- Estimates monthly team time wasted
- Calls GitHub Models API (`openai/gpt-4o-mini`) to suggest a specific automation approach with tool, effort, and confidence
- Checks for duplicate/related issues
- Applies color-coded frequency labels, removes `triage` label
- Posts a structured AI Triage Report comment

### 3. Visualize — Dashboard

- Single-file static site (`docs/dashboard/index.html`) served via GitHub Pages
- Loads `dashboard-data.json` (generated by workflow) → falls back to GitHub API → falls back to sample data
- **Summary cards**: total ideas, wins, hours saved/month
- **Toil table**: sortable, filterable by team/category/status, inline-editable scores (persisted in localStorage)
- **Insight panels**: radial automation gauge, risk watchlist, team focus radar
- **Team breakdown**: per-team stats with rename support
- Dark mode (auto-detects + toggle), print-friendly, responsive, accessible (`prefers-reduced-motion`)

### 4. Celebrate — Win Tracking

- When an issue gets the `automated` label, `win-celebration.yml` auto-comments on the original toil issue and closes it
- Monthly ROI summary (`monthly-roi-summary.yml`) creates a metrics issue on the 1st of each month

### 5. Maintain — Staleness & Hygiene

- `stale.yml` nudges idle toil issues after 30 days, closes after 60
- Exempts `in-progress`, `automated`, and `high-impact` labels

## Data Model

All data lives in GitHub Issues. No external database.

| Entity | Stored As | Key Fields |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Toil idea | Issue (label: `toil`) | submitter, team, description, frequency, time, people, category |
| Win | Issue (label: `automated`) | related issue #, what was automated, time saved, effort |
| Triage report | Issue comment | score breakdown, priority, AI suggestion |
| Dashboard snapshot | `docs/dashboard/dashboard-data.json` | summary stats, per-team/category breakdowns, all items |
| Monthly summary | Issue (label: `roi-summary`) | counts, automation rate, links |

## Scoring Details

### Frequency Scores
| Option | Score | Monthly Multiplier |
|--------|-------|--------------------|
| Multiple times per day | 8 | 60 |
| Daily | 5 | 20 |
| Multiple times per week | 3 | 10 |
| Weekly | 2 | 4 |
| Monthly or less | 1 | 1 |

### Time Scores
| Option | Score | Minutes |
|--------|-------|---------|
| > 1 hour | 8 | 75 |
| 30–60 minutes | 5 | 45 |
| 15–30 minutes | 3 | 22 |
| 5–15 minutes | 2 | 10 |
| < 5 minutes | 1 | 3 |

### People Scores
| Option | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Multiple teams / org-wide | 8 |
| Entire team | 5 |
| 4–6 people | 3 |
| 2–3 people | 2 |
| Just me | 1 |

**Monthly time estimate** = `monthly_multiplier × minutes × people_score`

## Labels

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `toil` | All toil ideas |
| `triage` | Awaiting AI scoring (auto-removed after triage) |
| `high-impact` | Score ≥ 20 |
| `quick-win` | Could be automated quickly |
| `in-progress` | Automation under development |
| `automated` | Toil eliminated 🎉 |
| `roi-summary` | Monthly metrics issues |

## Non-Goals

- No external databases, APIs, or paid services
- No user authentication beyond GitHub
- No real-time collaboration features (GitHub Issues handles this)
- No mobile-native app (dashboard is responsive web)
- No integration with project management tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to log a toil idea | < 2 minutes |
| AI triage turnaround | < 60 seconds after submission |
| Automation rate (automated / total) | Increasing month-over-month |
| Monthly time recovered | Tracked per-team on dashboard |
| Team participation | ≥ 1 submission per person per month |

## Technical Constraints

- **Zero dependencies**: no npm, no build step, no Docker
- **GitHub-native only**: Issues, Actions, Pages, Models API
- **Single-file dashboard**: all HTML, CSS, and JS in one file
- **All Actions pinned to SHA**: for supply-chain security
- **All `${{ }}` expressions in `env:` blocks**: prevents injection attacks
